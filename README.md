# How to use
In order to successfully change your macros :
1. first you must load this chrome extension into your browser
2. Login to your myfitnesspal website
3. Change your macros to anything, 40% fat 40% protein 20% carbs (it doesn't matter, this step is used to sniff traffic and get your user-id and Bearer token to make the custom call)
4. Next Click on the browser extension and fill in your details (calories, protein, carbs, fat)
5. Click submit and profit.
6. I did notice that it doesn't show up with the new macros on the desktop website, but if you open the app on your mobile device you will see the new custom macros you placed in there.
